14041,"How do parents protect their kids from unfair, biased or generally awful treatment from high school teachers?","I do this for a living. I mean part of my job. 

The number one advice I give to parents on anything school related is ""trust but verify."" This means that if you hear something from your kid about whatever thing that happened check with the teacher, check the teacher by looking at attendance records, dates that homework was completed and submitted (which is often done digitally) and be connected with other parents who may be able to share insights on all of it with you.

Clear out your voicemail box and check your messages regularly, read your emails at least once a day. Learn how the platforms work for checking your child's grades, attendance, and etc. This means knowing the passwords and account names and etc. If there is a feature or app so that you can check these things on a mobile phone learn it and know it extremely well. 

If any of this includes things that are beyond your abilities or you just don't have mental or emotional bandwidth for it then find someone at your school whose job it is to help you stay connected. If a person like that does not exist then work with other parents and your school board to get somebody there who is. 

In addition to all of that if this is not working for you then you find somebody who you trust absolutely and sign a release for them to be the one who deals with this for you. This could be the kid's aunt or uncle, it could be an older sibling, I have even seen cousins, Pastors, and certainly coaches and tutors who help parents with this if they are asked to do so. 

Some of the time if people know they are being watched it helps to keep them honest. So that goes from the entire spectrum of your kid to the top administrator in a school or district. 

I could go on and on but one thing I will say is that it is perfectly ok to disagree with people. Do it in a cordial way as much as possible, but if you have a difference of opinion about your child's needs you can tell people what it is. But try to have your facts straight and be open to alternative suggestions. Just don't feel the need to cave or that the teacher or administrator is going to lose respect for you if you disagree with them. On the contrary, sometimes they will go back and check their own facts and details and policies and procedures because they know that you are going to hold them accountable.

Finally, sometimes your kid is wrong and they are being immature or asking you to ""fight their battles for them."" Most of the time that is ok for you to stand up for your kid when the facts are unclear once in awhile to ensure their voice is heard. Occasionally though a kid will persist in unacceptable behavior and where there is no excuse for it (such as a learning difference or trauma or health concern, etc). If you keep going to bat for your kid when that kid is off the beam or trying to manipulate people then you will lose the respect of the administration and everyone will get completely bogged down in trying to avoid dealing with you rather than proactively working to make sure your child is learning. 

Last thing for anyone who made it this far. In hopefully rare cases your kid is not being served by the school due to entrenched racism, discrimination, incompetence, malpractice level under-staffing, a culture of cliques and bullying that other parents are unwilling to address with their kids, etc. In those cases you need to cut your losses and get your child out of that environment. Find another school that will meet their needs. It is not your child's job to teach school personnel or other kids how to act when the system is completely broken for what that kid needs. It is always sad when that happens but over the last two years I quit telling people to wait out the process. This is a very personal decision and ultimately the child's parent is in the best position to decide what is best for their kid."

I wasn't the biggest, richest or most athletic. I had nothing to offer socially to an already established system in school.

People often said things and I let that slide. I never took physical abuse from another kid though. Being smaller I learned to be excessive in retaliation to physical bullying.

They may give you a black eye today but if you don't do something about it I learned I would become far worse. More people would jump on the band wagon that it was acceptable to treat me with disdain.

There were illegal detention camps all across the country, where people were detained, tortured and killed. Now these places are common military bases and the like.

A woman, married to a military man, moved to the neighborhood near the base where he was stationed. The first night she spent there alone with her children (her husband was on duty) she woke up to the sound of footsteps in the living room, heavy steps, like military boots. Thinking it was her husband, she got up to see but there was no one there. She went to bed and again the same. Throughout the night the steps continued advancing down the hall until they stopped in front of her door. Minutes passed in silence and she thought it was over. Suddenly the door was kicked open and someone yanked her covers in the dark. She got up terrified and turned on the lights, there was no one. Scared shitless, she took her children and left in the middle of the night, never to spend a night there again. The place had been a detention camp."

15069,"People of reddit who don‚Äôt like the idea of getting married via a traditional wedding event, why?","Because it's become a massive debt event.

During the 19th Century in America, weddings were usually small family gatherings at the home of either the parents of the bride or the parents of the groom. The ceremonies were intimate and not elaborate. Weddings did not become elaborate until the 1820s and 1830s, when upper class couples would have wedding ceremonies similar to what is common today.

The wedding industry began to take shape between the 1920s and the 1950s. Claiming ties with ""ancient customs"" and various historical periods, the wedding industry promoted new goods and services as timeless and unchanging. It introduced new ring customs and wedding apparel fashions, and ""modern"" services, such as gift registries that rationalized gift customs, bridal salons that saved time and made wedding planning more efficient, and wedding packages that standardized ceremonies and reception celebrations. 

During World War II, the traditional white wedding grew even more prevalent as jewelers and bridal gown manufacturers successfully sought exemptions from wartime restrictions, linking the diamond engagement ring, the double-ring ceremony, and the formal white wedding gown with democracy and American prosperity. By the 1950s, the wedding industry had made the formal white wedding tradition a part of a new cult of marriage and the modern American Dream. - Brides, Inc.

Who would be left to fight? what do you think would be some reasons, aside from human rights issues, assuming they would have made an effort and changed this, that current NATO nations would object and try to block them?","NATO is not some loosey-goosey worldwide alliance open to anyone.  It is governed by a specific treaty.  Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty (the founding document of NATO) states that it covers only members' territory in Europe and North America, Turkey and islands in the North Atlantic north of the Tropic of Cancer.  Neither China nor Russia have territory in that region, so there's literally no territory to defend for either of them.  There's simply no geographic qualifications for either nation to join NATO.

Note there are certain cooperative agreements between NATO and some non-NATO countries, as far away as Australia.  These various agreements (Partnership for Peace, Mediterranean Dialogue, Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, Global Partners) provide for some information sharing and military cooperation, but none obligate NATO members to aid in the defense of non-NATO countries (at least not because of the North Atlantic Treaty).

So there are ways for China and Russia to act cooperatively with NATO (in fact, Russia is - maybe was at this point - part of the Partnership for Peace).  But neither has territory subject to the NATO founding treaty."

Sure, Russia is run by folks who'd fit any meaningful definition of fascism also, but that is beside the point. There are really ""no good guys"" in a Ukraine v Russia fight, and it is moronic for the West to back Ukraine just to piss off Russia. 

Armies generally don't care if an enemy uses CBR (chem/bio/radiological) weapons because they are protected from its effects. Nuclear weapons are a bit different, of course, on account of their immediate capacity for physical destruction. 

As for the UN, censure is done by a combination of the UN General Assembly, which has fuck-all power itself, and the UN Security Council, whose main members including Russia and the US have veto powers. The UNGA routinely condemns the most powerful countries in the world (read as ""the US and its allies"") and nothing is ever done because it has no real authority on account of not having its own military arm. The UNSC has the power to mandate sanctions, multilateral military action, etc but depends on the cooperation of its permanent members to do so. So in short, the US and UK would veto any meaningful attempt to bring Ukraine to account."

Why? 

The melanopsin ganglion cells in your eyes that direct kinda when it's time to be awake and alert are angled Slightly upwards. They kinda scan the skyline / kinda above you....

If you look down / get your light from more indirect lower down sources you will get sleepy.

It's why sky lights and ergonomic desk spaces are a thing.

And why phones keep you super awake because it's hard to give these cells some chill when on a phone screen. Which is also too bright for the given time. It's not just blue light. Blue light is just the most intense.

Wanna be awake: lots of light from above you.

Want to fall asleep? Gradually lower light sources and make them more indirect as the day goes on... Does wonders on your circadian rhythm and sleep health too.

There's a reason people tend to fix their sleep like instantly on a camping trip. The sun is the master headlight there..it just gets darker what most people are used to way earlier as we all extend into the night with lights."

The only thing I recall is you'd need a dvd drive that is writable, which means you'll be able to burn dvd discs with it. Youtube video will most probably be in mp4, so you gotta convert to maybe an avi or mpeg format. You could just Google ""mp4 to avi"" and use those generators online to download the video in that format. The last time I burned a disc was on Windows XP, with the DVD drive, you have the options to either burn as a data or as an ISO disc or something. I don't even know if Windows 10 has this option still. Maybe it'll be different with more modern, 3rd party, dvd drives. If you're gonna use it on a dvd player back in the mid 2000's, I suggest to burn it with both ways, do a trial and error to see which way works. It really depends on the supported format the dvd player has as well."

my father, a busy man then, brought up to have that boundless confidence in his own ability to repair things in his own home he has no business tinkering with‚Äî just.. scratched his head and gave up.


I'm not sure what confounded him about the situation so, and being four then, as i was, i didnt think to ask him. He says he tried a few things here and there..

It's not intentional and I wouldn't be consciously less likely to want to be friends with someone I considered unattractive but I think there are some sub conscious factors at play.


People are attracted to status - that can come from looks, skill, charisma, wealth, power but If you admire someone for something even as shallow as appearances it can draw you to them.



Also it's hard to explain but I think there's also a factor of how you think other people will view you. If you're standing amongst a group of attractive well put together friends, even if you're the least attractive one you'll feel that outsiders will view you as being like your (attractive) friends."

Ok so July 24 I bought three tickets to an event in PA. I was going with my friend Will and my brother Matt. With the conversion it was $80 CAD. That same day my brother started posting links to hotels, said ""Since it starts on Saturday, I presume we fly out Friday leave either Sunday in the late afternoon or Monday anytime"". He posted a link regarding the land border. Will sent a voice message telling me he is so busy and that he is not being a neglectful friend. How will get me the money asap.   
Aug 20. I message Matt and Will with a link saying the land border closure has been extended another 30 days. I say, ""So how long do we wait to book our flights"". We could wait 30 days to see if they open the border, but we could miss out on deals. I suggest we look at flights, and if we see any deals buy and make sure we can cancel if the border does open. My brother responds with ""The problem is flights that you can change and or cancel are very expensive. Typically,"" Will responded with ""Agreed we should at least peek. Jared is a whiz at finding deals"". I said, ""I'm checking Priceline tomorrow what's the maximum you're willing to pay and how long are you willing to wait to book.""   
Aug 21 Matt sends one potential itinerary. and tells us that ""He has been checking already and has put in a request to Flight Center and they said they would get back to him"". I send some flights I find Aug 21 at 6:39 PM. Converted to CAD it would be $412 which was about $200 less than what I had paid to fly down in 2019. I mentioned that I had been messaging  another friend of ours who was going. Chris was the friend I was messaging, and he told me ""He was going to decide at the beginning of October wither to fly or drive. I told Matt and Will that I was ok with waiting until Sept 21, to see if the border opens. That if it doesn't open, then we can buy the cheapest flight we can find. How we need to be on the same flight. (By this time, we were staying at a friend‚Äôs home.), so he wasn‚Äôt waiting for each of us to arrive. Sept 1 Will says ""K. Coolio Let's keep our eyes peeled.  
Sept 12 Matt reminds us that if we fly, we need a negative COVID test, how it must be taken 72 hours before we leave and 72 hours before we come back. Sept 20, Matt sends the link that the USA Canada land border closure has been extended another 30 days. Sept 26, I say so let's talk flights Will sends a voice message same day saying ""That he is getting a lot of pushbacks from Teresa and rightfully so, as Braydon isn't vaccinated. Want to be sure that we are taking the right precautions"". I sent them both a screenshot of tweet posted on Sept 7 from Exhumed Films about the safety measures starting that week at the Colonial Theatre. I mentioned that Chris's wife is giving him heck too. How The Rolling Stones are still doing their upcoming stadium tour, and that Alanis still her did her tour. How no one there will be unvaccinated. How if they were concerned at all Exhumed Films would cancel the event. How I am angry at Anti-Vaxxers. Will says ""Let's see how things go. We are getting closer, of course. As stated above, I have my concerns. I say ""Me too I want to go but I'm also nervous at the same time. If we could get more info on actual numbers and a guarantee of no non vaccinated people in the theatre I'd be more at ease. Will said ""Agreed Completely. They're much more reckless in the States.   
Oct 9, I send them the response I got from the Colonial Theatre about how many tickets were actually sold"". Will asked about the ""safety protocols they mentioned"". I sent the link with the information. How another friend  Justin who is going, is going to see Halloween 4-6 at the same venue. Will says ""I just saw that programmed! I'm double vexed, do I still need a test""? Matt and I reiterate the having to take a PCR test 72 hours before you fly out, and 72 hours before you fly in. Oct 12, he says ""Guys I may have to bail. This is getting costly and dicey"". Flight+another $400 in tests +everything else, never mind safety/health concerns. Oct 15 the last message in our group chat of Matt, Will and I is my brother sending the link saying the border would open Nov 8.  
In my own chat with Will Oct 12, I let him know that Chris was cancelling as he couldn't put a price on his kids‚Äô safety. Will says maybe sell our tickets as we have 4 (It was 3 but whatever.) as a group of tickets will be easier to sell. I contact the promotors to see if under the circumstances we could get a refund; but I never heard back. Will says ""I just can't put my family in danger Brayden not vaccinated. I do say I wish they'd cancel the event; however, I'd be really upset seeing our friends having a good time and not being there. But if I didn't go and God forbid there was an outbreak of cases from the event, then I would be glad I didn't go.  


Before we saw that the border was opening Nov 8. I sent Will the link saying the border is opening. Will said ""Woah really""???? that it might change things. Oct 21, he says 'BTW, I think I'm definitely going to have to bow out for Philly. Just can't see it happening. Brayden not vaccinated etc. I said I'm trying to sell my ticket, and not having any luck, as it's too soon to the event. I had posted it a few weeks prior then reposted it the week of Oct 21.   
Then Oct 23 he checks in to Scotiabank Arena in Toronto taking his son William for his 13th birthday to see a Toronto Raptors game. I lose my shit and so does my brother. We talk about it between the two of us, I start letting people know that unless a miracle happens, I am out and how a friend waited 16 days before the event to bail. Everyone has my back. Especially once I tell them about the NBA game and ALL the places they went as a family or just his wife Teresa with Girlfriends etc. How angry I am. I wanted advice and one of my friends said Will's excuse was lame and that he and his wife's actions since Summer 2020 have been inconsistent and hypocritical. I agree 100% I get that for some people flying is riskier to them then say being at an indoor or outdoor event. I just look at all the photos they posted, and I think ""If you are so concerned about your kid‚Äôs safety, you could've fooled me"". It's a not a good look to bail 16 days before an event and leave my brother and I high and dry then go to a basketball game with a full capacity crowd of 19,800. IE. Like flying your indoors in an enclosed environment, a lot of people, touching surfaces etc.   
I do acknowledge I was nervous and was a bit unsure about going; but I was more on the side of going, and I was doing all the work to find flights and I couldn't understand why he couldn't spend a little time being more involved in the trip planning. It's like he had made up his mind a while ago, and for whatever reason didn't tell us till Oct 21.   
What should've happened was the three of us should have committed by end of August at the latest, and if he wasn't sure etc. Then Matt and I should've said to each other ""Do we want to take the risk and go alone"". If not, we need to hustle and sell our tickets"". If we do, we need to book a flight now and figure out the PCR test, where to go, how much, get an appointment. etc. We waited for Will to make up his mind and we should never have done that, as it brought us down with him. Matt feels that Will thought the land border would open, but I'm not sure it would've made a difference. Every group message we sent Will took his time answering, and it was always vague.   
How if he was uncomfortable going, he should have said so from the start; or not buy a  ticket. How I (Jared) was doing all the leg work and Will would not commit one way or the other. That if we decided to do this event next year we wouldn't bother including Will. I feel the same way. Working out, Rugby, and watching movies with or without the family was more important than committing to this and deciding. I get he's a busy guy.... but if we are taking a trip during a pandemic, I think that this is bit more of a priority then watching movies. He was too chill and non committal about the whole thing. I have lost a lot of respect for him. I don't plan on doing anything with him like this again. I told Matt we did everything right stayed home when we were told to. Only went to the movies when it was allowed. Saved $$$ etc., and we still got burned by someone who clearly was flaunting the rules last summer.  


Last summer Will and his wife and 2 kids went to two cottages and with two different groups of about people. They posted photos on Facebook where they had posed with their friends and we not wearing masks, and not social distancing. They also went to Toronto to try out different ethic cuisines, ands his wife went on an impromptu girls trip weekend with 4 friends, and a spa weekend with another friend. Will also wen to Canada's Wonderland a few times. They also went to beaches, an outdoor zip lining attraction,  etc. It seemed like every day they were going somewhere, and IMHO.... If you are so concerned about your family's safety, you stay the hell at home and don't go traipsing all over the city of Toronto, and nearby cottage and beach areas. Every time you go out somewhere, even if you take precautions, you are still taking a huge risk and if god forbid you get sick, and don't realize it. You could be spreading it to a lot of people."

7823,"Getting a cat soon, what are some cool products maybe from amazon or other online stores?","As for toys and entertainment, it will depend on your cat. I‚Äôve had 5 kittens at once, and not all of them loved the same toys or the same beds. While one of them would love playing on the tablet, another loved a fishing rod toy, and the freaky one would go crazy for a bath sponge.  
  
So buy some cheap toys and see what kind your cat loves the most. Then you can spend more in good quality toys of that kind.  
  
What you can buy beforehand is a good litter box. Pick what works for you. I‚Äôd recommend the ones that can‚Äôt be turned over. With taller sides to avoid a mess.  
If you can remove the top part of the sides (not sure if this is how you say it) it‚Äôll be a good option since a small kitten won‚Äôt be able to use a litter box with tall sides.  
  
Get some scratching posts or surfaces your kitty can destroy when they feel the need to scratch. Otherwise it‚Äôll be your furniture and things you wanted to keep in one piece.  
  
Most cats I knew loved fluffy fabric such as faux fur. To me it was a pain in the neck to clean those things up but it was worth it since the cats loved it more than my bed or the surfaces I didn‚Äôt want them to sleep on."

Then, instead of trying to get rid of them, allow them be there and do their thing while you do yours, which is to engage in rewarding activities or think about other things. 

If you find yourself focusing on the negatives again, don't scold yourself. Instead accept that you did that, give yourself credit for noticing, and gently return focus to the thing you want to focus on instead.

If you're interested, look up ""defusion"" from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy."

Slept through the rest of saturday, stayed through sunday, then left to go to school on monday morning (it was like half a mile away and I knew how to get there). I ate a bunch of the free breakfast that comes with morning daycare, and just spent my day there. I used their phone to call my mom, who was angry at me for leaving the house without locking the door (not that I had a key). 

I casually told some of the staff what happened to explain why I didnt have my homework done and they didnt believe me. They asked my mom like not even seriously, and she denied it.

I think it's driven by a couple of things. Number one is a shallow view of relationships, in essence, we're here for sex, so I'll show you mine, you can show me yours, and then we can get down to business. If you're not here for dick, then why waste my time?

The other thing is that is very hard to learn from your mistakes as a man because an extremely high percentage of your advances will be rejected. Think of the percentage of dude's advances you've actually entertained. Yeah. That's roughly how often dudes swing and miss. Even if you're doing everything right you know how to do, you'll still fail 99% of the time.

Lastly, there are the Louis C.K. types. The fact that women react at all, even negatively, is what gets them off, so there's not really a downside to, say, sitting in your car and waiting for women to jog by (this happened to an ex-girlfriend of mine). Negative attention seeking behavior is usually tied to abuse. I also think there is a relatively small subset of dudes who send out a lot of these photos, but these dudes get around. Same goes for subway gropers in Japan.

Just to be clear, I think it's all fucked up and gross.

EDIT: I also want to point out that, because women virtually never compliment men (because it is very likely to be misconstrued) we typically don't know what our attractive features are, if any. I found out women were into forearms when I was in my 20s, and that's not universal, and I don't think mine are particularly attractive, so this information does me exactly no good. Men really think straight women are into dicks, especially big ones, because there's no countervailing info, just pornography. I had a cashier at a Costco tell me she liked my beard several years ago (the only compliment I can remember), and I'm still not really certain she wasn't having a laugh at my expense because at the time I did nothing to it."

A brief introduction: The war began in 2014. Then, for the first time, Russian troops violated Ukraine's borders, capturing Crimea and parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Here is a description of the same events in the wiki. I recommend reading the [Ukrainian](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D1%96%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D1%81%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%96_%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%97%D0%BD%D0%B8) and [Russian](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B6%D1%91%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%82_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B5_%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B) versions with Google Translator. They describe the same events differently. The same difference in the description of events persists today.

Current events: The situation is stressful. Russian troops have surrounded Ukraine and are very close to its borders.  In short, Russia says Ukraine plans to attack Russia, and Russia is ready to respond

1. Shelling of Stanytsia Luhanska on February 17. Russian militants fired on peaceful areas and hit a kindergarten. Russian media say it was done by Ukrainians, and it's all a staging ""because the windows in the kindergarten remained intact.""
2. February 18. The evacuation of civilians in the occupied territories was announced. Women, children and the elderly are deported to Russia. Men are drafted into the army.  We fear that Russia may blow up buses carrying evacuees to escalate the conflict. It was similar when Russia attacked Georgia. But [Pushilin's video](https://www.5.ua/regiony/zvernennia-pro-evakuatsiiu-vatazhky-dnr-i-lnr-zapysaly-shche-16-liutoho-na-tse-vkazaly-metadani-268610.html?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=smm&fbclid=IwAR03Fok_ldK3fENBik9g0PKF-Zx1ULMRoQRVHKc8I7nY0k1b6MT01dOulms) appeal about the evacuation was recorded on February 16. People downloaded a video of the appeal and checked the creation date
3. February 19. Russia says the Ukrainian shell hit Russia, Rostov region. By the evening there were three such explosions. In Ukraine, they say that the shelling is carried out from the occupied territories. Biden says Russia plans to attack Kyiv, and fighting in the east is a distraction.

Personally from me: Many people say that Russia will not attack Ukraine because it is not economically viable. But Russia has done a lot of unprofitable things before. Well, there is a benefit. If Russia destroys the gas pipeline on the territory of Ukraine, Europe will be able to buy only through Nord Stream 2, which was recently completed. Russia's main income comes from the sale of natural resources

""The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.""

She once woke me up because she was about to give birth and needed me to open a drawer. She also woke me up when bats climbed through my tilted window.

She also understood that nodding meant ""yes"" and shaking your head meant ""no"".

But I shook my head whenever my grandma was still awake, meaning it was too early for her to be inside. She just sat down and watched me leave then. But if I nodded, she just came running in.

Love her to this day!

Its not always inbthe front of my mind but its always there. Times when its very bad is when i have nightmares. Two weeks ago i had an episode at 3am and woke up thinking i was having a heart attack. Luckily it was just an extreme anxiety attack. I couldnt stop shaking, couldnt stand up, my entire body hurt and cramped, could hardly put a sentence together to wake my wife up and let her know that there was a problem. My blood sugar also bottomed out and no matter how many glucose tabs and carbs i ate could keep it up for more than 20 minutes.

Countless times I see an outlandish comment bashing the US, then when I check their profile it's like all they talk about. Like... America basically lives rent free in their head.

I rarely experience this type of behavior in person when I travel. I assume it's mainly online by people who don't get out much. Similar to Americans who relentless believe they are superior."

15261,What is the scariest theory known to man?,"The dual consciousness theory disturbed me when I read about it. 

Basically (in my limited, layman understanding), a corpus callosotomy is a procedure that is sometimes used to treat conditions like epilepsy, where the connection between the two halves of the brain is severed. People can survive this and continue to live semi normally, but usually with some cognitive impairments. Both halves of the brain continue to be 'alive', but there is little to no communication between the two sides.

People who undergo the procedure can also exhibit some strange phenomena like alien hand syndrome, where the patient feels like some of their limbs will move on their own accord. They can also have difficulty controlling their non-dominant hand, trouble speaking, and issues with certain parts of their vision.

The dual consciousness theory posits that both halves of the brain retain a consciousness after this procedure. Essentially, you become two people sharing the same body, completely unaware of each other. One variation of the theory is that one half of the brain is dominant, controlling most bodily functions, while the other half is basically cut off from most external stimuli, unable to communicate with the outside world, for their rest of their life.

**Edit:** Just editing this to add that obviously this is only a theory and may not be correct. Also, even with the concerns around the operation I can totally understand parents choosing this for their kids - epilepsy can be a debilitating disease and this could be the only option. My sister had epilepsy and thankfully she got over it with medication, but it is brutal. Not everyone who has this operation has the side effects that I described, many of them lead normal lives. I'm not disturbed by people who have had this operation, just by the implications the theory could have for consciousness in general."

9782,"former racists of reddit, what made you think the way you do and how did you get out of racism?","Lets pretend you‚Äôve never seen a platypus.   But you‚Äôve heard about them.   You‚Äôve heard that they have a bill and webbed feet.  You‚Äôve heard that they lay eggs.  You‚Äôve heard that they have a tail like a beaver.   But you, yourself, have never seen one.   You take for granted that these things are true because EVERYONE around you says they are.

I grew up in a super tiny farm town in the middle of nowhere.  All 300 people in the town were white.  My parents were racist.  My friends were racist.  My friend‚Äôs parents were racists.  Even the vast majority of teachers in our k-12 school grew up in or around my town, and were racist.  Guess what?  With literally every single person around me telling me that black people were inferior, i thought black people were inferior.  I took for granted that it was true, because it seemed unlikely that EVERYONE was wrong.   Just like I currently take for granted that a platypus lays eggs.

When I was 10 I went to a summer camp a few hours north of me.  There were black, hispanic, and asian kids there.   Hell, I even shared a cabin with a black kid.   I honestly thought I would get attacked at night.   By the end of the third day of camp, I realized that other than talking a bit different, my black cabinmate was no different than my white cabinmates.   And the talking a bit different thing didn‚Äôt bother me.   I had family from other parts of the US that talked different from me, and it didn‚Äôt matter much.

This started a slow but steady realization in me that maybe my parents were wrong about things, and maybe people were just people.   I‚Äôd like to think that I treat everyone with the same level of respect today.  I sincerely hope I do, anyway.

Still not sure about platypus though.

Edit: This has gotten some attention, so I‚Äôd like to share another story.

After high school, I moved to Kansas City and rented a home with some friends in a nicer part of town.  One day my car broke down, and I was determined to fix it myself by watching youtube videos despite having zero experience with cars.   This resulted in my car being up on blocks for nearly 2 months.

One of my better friends from work was a guy we‚Äôll call Bob.    Bob was black, and drove a super run down car.   We had an agreement that if he drove me to and from work every day, I would put a tank of gas in his car once a week and buy lunches for us now and then.

One day, we got pulled over on the way in to work.  The cop asked Bob if he knew why he was being pulled over, and Bob said no.   The cop then made a big deal about how Bob was driving erratically.   After asking a few questions, he let us go without a ticket.    I thought the whole thing was odd, as Bob‚Äôs driving was just fine, but we didn‚Äôt really talk about it much.

A few weeks later it happened again.   After the cop let us go, I turned to Bob and said, ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ was this because you are black?!‚Äù   Bob looked at me like I was the dumbest thing he had seen all week, and then informed me of the concept of Driving While Black.  He said you can drive through the nice part of town while black, but only if you have a nice car.  If you have a crap car while black, you are immediately suspected of doing something wrong.

This was a real eye opener for me.   While I would have said that I didn‚Äôt see black people as inferior to white people, I certainly didn‚Äôt fully grasp that there really is two different worlds in our country.  I didn‚Äôt get the gravity or scope of being subtlety (or not so subtlety) treated like a second class citizen.  I am POSITIVE that I still don‚Äôt fully get it.

I guess my point with this is:  You can pull yourself out of racism, but still not be able to appreciate the harm racism does, or the pervasiveness of it.

I had an easy go of things, we only lost 1 man in an entire 13 months from my platoon.  I kinda loved it, it felt like the Wild West a bit.   We had very lacking leadership who sorta threw us out on our own and didn't wanna be outside the Fob a lot, so we basically ran our own shit, just a bunch of dumbass kids, trading fucking hesco barriers for cans of whiskey from the sheiks and shit.   tripping out on Robatussin and shooting tracer rounds into the sky... ya know, good clean fun u can't have when there's not a war going on.

I also really enjoyed not paying taxes on anything, not even my income, and pirate movies and bootleg shit are all legal and sold everywhere for dirt cheap.

&#x200B;

Did not like the ""war"" part of things.   I only was in a few direct engagements and never actually seemed very serious, the only scary thing was running over roadside bombs, or getting hit with a mortar, but after like a month of being scared everytime u hear a whistle, u get used to it and carry on like nothing's happening.  Sorta weird, i think it breaks your natural fear mechanism, or you end up with PTSD, both are weird to live with afterward."

I guess I was looking to the left a little , very stoned, and I didn‚Äôt see a truck parked on the 3 lane road but it was in the turning lane. My buddy in the passenger seat just says ‚Äúwhoa‚Äù and I look up and I‚Äôm heading right for it, and I‚Äôm doing about 50 and it‚Äôs wet out. Something in me calculates exactly how much to let off the gas and turn without sliding and not even making this shit up- it was so slight of a miss, that the lift gate on the truck, which would have decapicated both of us, hit the passenger window and made the entire truck slide and it blew out the window, it was the loudest fucking sound I‚Äôve ever experienced. I happen to glance at my buddy when it happened and I don‚Äôt know where the flash of light came from, perhaps the vehicle yellow flasher, but I looked at my friends face and saw in slow motion what looked liked an exploding crown of thorns on Jesus (he has long hair and a beard and looks like Jesus) the glass went into the back of his neck and ear but none of it hit my eyes which it definitely would have if he didn‚Äôt turn my way when the window blew out. The car shifted about 1.5 feet from the pressure of the window pop. This is a 5.8 V8 Nissan Titan . Going 50 mph. I don‚Äôt know if I believe in god now, but I believe a force of nature saved our lives on Christmas Eve.

4317,What‚Äôs something that‚Äôs considered socially acceptable that you think shouldn‚Äôt be?,"I‚Äôm prepared to be downvoted for this one‚Ä¶.

Porn. 
I‚Äôm so tired of hearing the old ‚ÄúmAsTurBatIoN pReVeNtS pRoStAte CaNCeR!!‚Äù excuse, despite the fact that if it was a proven cure we would have doctors prescribing it. People use that as a reason to masturbate daily because it makes them feel less guilty for doing something they know will only dig them into a deeper hole. 
I could go on about how the porn industry abuses women by forcing them to consent to scenes or risk being blacklisted, along with drug use in order to maintain their thin body, but I won‚Äôt bore you all with stuff you should already know. 

Let‚Äôs talk about Men. 
Men have the highest depression rates, the highest suicide rates and teenage boys are at a very high risk of going down the path to ‚Äúinceldom‚Äù if they don‚Äôt feel loved by others. Instead of encouraging boys to face their fears and go outside, we are allowing them to hide in their rooms and watch two people who they don‚Äôt know have intercourse in order to fill the void in their hearts. We all know that teenagers today are having less sex than they did in, say, the 80‚Äôs, and the percentage of kids who have even had their first kiss has gone down. I am not blaming porn for this, but it doesn‚Äôt help that we have teenagers who don‚Äôt know what the touch of another girl/boy feels like who are able to and are ENCOURAGED to ignore those real life desires and seek out temporary ways to feel better. Porn often ruins their future sexual relationships with false ideas of what their partner wants, and often changes the way men view women in particular. 

I don‚Äôt care if I get negative karma from this, I needed to get this off of my chest."

Then I'd hint at the gifts she'd be getting, which would make her Christmas wonder grow. Then I'd decorate with all these lights and there'd be that Christmas magic for her. Then by Christmas eve her Christmas wonder would be at a fever pitch as I started to cook Christmas foods. I'd make pork dumplings that she could not touch until the next day (I'd let her sneak as many as she wanted as I silently smiled knowingly). I'd make it so that she'd feel like a kid again on Christmas, because she never got to have great Christmases due to growing up in not great circumstances and that's where her dislike of Christmas came from. I'd always buy her presents of all the things I'd see her get excited about throughout the year, like a lego Star Wars set or a dress or whatever it was, and buy presents centered around those things, too. It was all about her. Since she passed, I kind of just make a small meal for myself and sit on the couch watching nostalgic Christmas movies and I still buy her a little something to put next to her picture. Last year it was a Grogu Christmas snow globe, because she loved the Mandalorian. I'm sad, I know. This year I will eat something nice and watch Home Alone, I guess."

14921,"Those of you who are always ‚Äúrunning 15 minutes late‚Äù in the mornings, why not just set your alarm 15 minutes earlier?","Both of my parents are chronically late to everything - often way more than 15 minutes. I'd say there are two reasons:

1. Poor sense of how much time anything will take. They just don't understand how long it takes to drive somewhere, or how long it takes them to do something. And they don't believe others. I'll tell them, ""Google says this place is 35 mins away"" and my dad will respond, no that's wrong, last time it only took me 20 minutes. Of course, last time he was 15 mins late... or he doesn't believe that traffic might be different, or anything else. They also don't get that nothing is zero time. We'll decide to leave at 5:30 and my mom will be like, ""OK let's go!"" which really means... get her purse, find her keys somewhere, change jacket 3 times, put on her shoes, turn off all the lights, forget something, look for it, turn off lights again... She thinks she's leaving at 5:30 because she thinks those are zero-time actions. They're not. She's leaving at 5:45 and doesn't realize it. This is the consistently 15-20 min late pattern to basically everything.
2. There is also a weird more intentional pattern that is somewhere between social anxiety and selfishness. They both HATE to be the first person somewhere, left waiting for others. For my mom, this causes huge social anxiety. For my dad, he gets angry. Yes, it's hypocritical. I think they both like the feeling of having everyone wait for them, and they walk in last, knowing that everyone is there and ready for them. For my dad, he tends to walk in like star of the show - Ah great, everyone is here waiting for me!  For my mom, she walks in like - OMG, I'm so sorry, how kind of you all to wait! And everyone reassures her that it's fine, it's fine, and she gets like a little hit of feeling embraced or reassured or something? My dad regularly openly states that he would rather be late than early.  This is the pattern when it's a dinner, restaurant, or other social gathering, where they're usually 30-90 minutes late. 

Reason 1 was a terrible pattern that I learned growing up them and I used to always be late, too. It took me well into my 20s and a frustrated partner before I retrained myself to pay attention to how much time things actually take. Now I know if I need to leave at 5:30, that means I need to plan 10 or 15 mins of ""getting ready to leave"" time to actually leave at 5:30.

Edit: I had no idea so many people have parents like this! Thanks for introducing me to the term time-blindness. I've always called it ""zero time denial"". People think actions like putting on your shoes,  finding your keys, grabbing your water bottle, one more text, etc aren't taking time. EVERYTHING takes time. Maybe it's only 1 minute, but if you are doing 10 of them... that's 10 minutes. If you're driving,  getting gas and stoplights are also not zero-time actions. Paying attention to how much time things actually take was a major game changer for improving my lateness.

For my parents, there is no improving them. They are in their 70s. Yes, we lie about start times, we start without them, all of their clocks are adjusted forward. None of these tactics work long term. Yes, they've missed flights and concerts,  they've missed recitals and school events, I was late to school hundreds of times and got detentions regularly. Consequences aren't really impactful. Boomers are stubborn."

After dropping the car off, the penguin goes for a walk around town. He sees an ice-cream shop and, being a penguin in Arizona, decides that something cold would really hit the spot. He gets a big dish of ice cream and sits down to eat. Having no hands he makes a real mess trying to eat with his flippers.

I have my own fair share of scary experiences, mostly paranormal such as seeing a red eye poke out in the tall grass (Probably a Pok√©mon), Santa toy fell and turned on but it doesn‚Äôt have batteries, and witnessed two possessions, one in my classroom and during our field trip but the one that I will never forget lasted about a week. Long post ahead.

It was early November in 2010 and we‚Äôve just finished celebrating All Soul‚Äôs Day/Day of The Dead here in the Philippines. We lived in a small subdivision surrounded by kind neighbors so we didn‚Äôt really expect things to turn south that fast. 

It‚Äôs just me, my brother, my mom and dad, grandfather and cousin who‚Äôve been living in the house for about six months and so far, so good. My mom‚Äôs store is doing great, first time being able to watch Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, and I‚Äôve just started my Pokemon FireRed playthrough then it happened.

My cousin told us about the voices she hears at night and the constant banging she feels underneath her bed. We shrugged it off as some nightmare and days passed until she brought it up again but this time, she woke up nearby the stairs at 3am and that actually made my parents a little worried. I was a kid so I wasn‚Äôt actually scared, tbh I‚Äôm actually pretty pumped to experience my first actual paranormal activity. My brother on the other hand was quiet for some reason.

What my cousin told us the next day actually sent shivers down my spine. She was taking a bath and when she poured water on her back, it parted ways like someone or something was on her back. Initially, it wasn‚Äôt that scary but I was reminded of Shutter and boy, that scared me to death when we watched it (the scene on the ladder). It was then that my brother admitted that he can see spirits, actually, shadow and light figures and my dad actually experienced participating in an exorcism when he was still young.

That events that proceeded to unfold are just horrifying thinking about it now that I‚Äôm older. We had our first exorcism and it wasn‚Äôt what I expected it to be, she was just lying on the bed and saying weird stuff. I actually hoped that she‚Äôd levitate or rotate her head ngl. She was able to rip a page from the Bible before becoming stable. My brother heard voices of different genders and age. What‚Äôs worse is that she had to sleep in our room since her‚Äôs is cursed or something. She slept below the side where I usually sleep in and in that moment, I‚Äôve never wanted to sleep as fast in my entire life. The thought of opening your eyes and she‚Äôs floating above you or staring at you directly in your face ughh.

The next day was kinda tame. My cousin was doing fine and my grandpa just happened to see a lady in a black veil coming down from the stairs into the kitchen which was just an extension of the house. I was outside that time as well as my parents and brother so not the type of news we‚Äôd want to hear.

The next day was the grand finale, good vs evil as I watch everything unfold while eating a bowl of Pancit Canton noodles. It was the worst she‚Äôs ever been physically and it looked terrifying. She started doing incantations to which my dumb ten year old brain responded with more made up incantations. I did not take it seriously at all.

They decided to cleanse her room which was even more harder to do because of her brother participating in the cleanse and eventually getting possessed too. He looked at one of the images of my grandmother to which he described the eyes turning black and that‚Äôs when he lost control. He was friggin strong being able to take on my dad and priest‚Äô assistant. Eventually, she threw up a black necklace and decided to do a kill it on the dance floor as witnessed by my kid brain. She looked into a mirror and just like that, it was over. They took care of the mirror and she was brought into church rehab. We didn‚Äôt realize how many spectators we had outside of our house. 

We discovered that the owner of the house performed a ritual after the extension so yeah, we had to move out. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs just the house that‚Äôs haunted.

She‚Äôs doing fine now and so are we. According to some of our ex-neighbors, they still see figures inside her room when they walk past it.

Number one favorite game has to be Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise. I loved watching Fist of the North Star, and seeing Kenshiro in what is essentially a Yakuza game (it actually is one; the Japanese title is Hokuto Ga Gotoku) in really good Fist of the North Star cosplay is an amazing experience. It's not often that something captures the spirits of tender manliness and violent manliness from Fist of the North Star, much less does that AND adds humor that doesn't detract from it, but boom. This one does.

And the gameplay is fantastic. It's a really fucking fun game. Hard to describe otherwise.

Note: don't play if before watching or reading Fist of the North Star, because while it doesn't follow much of the plot, it does spoil the first 100+ episodes.

Honorable mentions include:

* Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse,
* Persona 5 Royal,
* Megaman Zero 3,
* Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3, and
* Smackdown: Here Comes the Pain."

As for oil, it depends on licenses and profitability. Just because an oil field still has oil doesn't mean it's profitable to drill for it. Plus a lot of  the recent license pursuits have been for areas close to protected lands if I remember my Trump years right. In addition this current government is pushing, or seeming to push, for greener energy so there is less incentive for the government to subsidize oil pursuits and less incentive for oil companies to pursue poor profits.

1043,What do you do for foreplay and how long does it last compared to the actual intercourse portion? What's the best YouTube had?,"My goal is for her to cum at least once during foreplay. Most women can‚Äôt cum from ‚Äúinsertion‚Äù sex, so it‚Äôs smart to linger on foreplay until they make you advance. Tease, kiss, feel their body, and undress in a way that makes them feel sexy. Foreplay should be at least half of sex imo. Go down on your partner more often. Ladies don‚Äôt get enough oral. Definitely try to have a conversation with any partner about what they like, if they cum often, or what their boundaries are. Informed sex is way better than guessing what they want. 

Pro tip: I institute a ‚Äútwo taps‚Äù policy. Tap your finger twice on your partner‚Äôs body if something that feels particularly good is happening. It‚Äôs often less awkward than verbal communication, and sex becomes more of a skill than a guessing game. It makes you good at having sex WITH THEM instead of just good at having sex.

Edit, from Wikipedia:

>The Doomsday Clock is a symbol that represents the likelihood of a man-made global catastrophe. Maintained since 1947 by the members of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the clock is a metaphor for threats to humanity from unchecked scientific and technical advances. The clock represents the hypothetical global catastrophe as midnight and the Bulletin's opinion on how close the world is to a global catastrophe as a number of minutes or seconds to midnight, assessed in January of each year. The main factors influencing the clock are nuclear risk and climate change. The Bulletin's Science and Security Board monitors new developments in the life sciences and technology that could inflict irrevocable harm to humanity.  
>  
>The clock's original setting in 1947 was seven minutes to midnight. It has been set backward and forward 24 times since, the farthest from midnight being 17 minutes in 1991, and the nearest being 100 seconds, from 2020 to the present.  
>  
>The clock was moved to two and a half minutes in 2017, then forward to two minutes to midnight in January 2018, and left unchanged in 2019. In January 2020, it was moved forward to 100 seconds before midnight. The clock's setting was left unchanged in both 2021 and 2022. Since 2010, the clock has been moved forward over four minutes, and has changed by five minutes and twenty seconds since 1947.  
>  
>Since 1947, the clock has been moved backward eight times and forward 16 times."

Also Fallout is an incredibly unrealistic depiction of post-nuclear war. Obviously nobody *knows* what the aftermath of a global nuclear war would be like, and some of what people think will happen do happen in the Fallout series, but Fallout takes it to quite a high extreme. For example it's commonly believed that a lot of radiation hazards would last upwards of a few decades *at most* after an attack, but in Fallout they apparently last for 200+ years.

edit: I recommend watching the 80s TV horror movie ""Threads."" It shows a lot of it in very graphic detail, and uses the most available science and speculation (*at the time*) to theorize on what a nuclear attack on a minor-English city would look like. Obviously a lot of things would change with major cities and with modern things such as the Internet, but it's still widely regarded as one of the most realistic pieces of fiction regarding a nuclear attack."

Didn't see the first shark for about half an hour. A tiger, thirteen footer - you know how you know that when you're in the water, Chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't know was our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, Chief, sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know, it was kinda like old squares in the battle like that you see in the calendar named 'The Battle of Waterloo.' And the idea was, the shark comes to the nearest man and he starts poundin' and hollerin' and screamin'. Sometimes the shark go away... Sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into ya, right into your eyes. Y'know, the thing about a shark, he's got lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eyes. When he comes after ya, he doesn't seem to be livin' until he bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white, and then... aww, then you hear that terrible, high-pitched screamin', the ocean turns red, and in spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin', they all come in and... rip ya to pieces. You know, by the end of that first dawn, we lost a hundred men. I don't know how many sharks, maybe a thousand. I don't know how many men. They averaged six an hour. On Thursday morning, Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player. Boatswain's mate. I thought he was asleep. I reached over to wake him up. Bobbed up, down in the water just like a kinda top. Upended. Well, he'd been bitten in half below the waist. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us. He swung in low and he saw us. He was a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper. Anyway, he saw us and he come in low and three hours later, a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know, that was the time I was most frightened - waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a life jacket again. So, eleven hundred men went in the water, three hundred and sixteen men come out, and the sharks took the rest, June the 29th, 1945.

I took Anatomy I my freshman year of college. One of my lab partners was studying to become a doctor. The kid had a photographic memory and easily scored over 100 on every exam.

Our cadaver was not properly embalmed as a result of its injury. All of the embalming fluid avoided the abdominal cavity and found a space in front of it just beneath the skin. Our cadaver was decomposing quickly and was thrown out before the exam, putting us at a huge disadvantage. They typically use them for at least two semesters, which should somewhat contextualize the rate of decay.

One day before class, this kid comes up to me. He says ""Hey, I think I found out why our cat smells so bad!""

I assumed he was going to tell me something I didn't know.

He said, ""It's the formaldehyde!""

It wasn't. The word ""formaldehyde"" was new to him, and I recalled knowing it at seven years old. It's a common word we should have all at least heard in an anti-smoking assembly at some point, right?

I'm mildly concerned because I think, with his grades, the kid will probably become a doctor. Doctors should have critical thinking skills, not just impressive regurgitating skills. A parrot could probably come close to med school, I figured out. Not to put doctors down, as I know many don't have photographic memories and work incredibly hard to truly understand and problem-solve, throughout school and afterward. I'd do it if I had support to get through med school, I think."

16642,"Non-Americans of Reddit: Enough USA bashing for a while. What is either A) something nice/good you can say about the USA, or B) something bad you can say about your own country?","Americans are, largely, accommodating and friendly people - regardless of their political affiliation, religion, etc. 

The beer quality/quantity and selection is unparalleled. The Yanks really do a good job with experimenting (e.g. the IPA explosion, barrel aged beers, sours) while also doing a good job of upholding European styles. Say what you want about generic American lager but the craft beer and small brewery scene is phenomenal. Beer enthusiasts from abroad should have an open mind and explore the scene in whatever city they happen to be in.

American sports are a blast. I'm not a big NFL football fan or baseball fan but going to a stadium and seeing those game splayed in person is a worthwhile experience. Not necessarily better or worse than any other big venue sporting event - just a lot of fun and interesting to get to understand those games. 

There's a kind of cultural consistency in America that I kind of like and have come to appreciate. The US states aren't *that* different form each other the way European countries are (or even the regions within European countries) but that's just sort of how America is. I can be in Oregon, Florida, California and there aren't too many subtle differences, culturally. I'm still in America. I dunno - maybe that should be a detractor but I kind of get why Americans refer to their country as a ""melting pot"".

America and Americans aren't tethered to tradition and that's why they seem to always be inventing new, cool shit (see my beer paragraph above). Imagine hip hop happening in any other country. Or jazz. 

 That said, I prefer living in my own country and just enjoy visiting the US now and again."

I agreed to babysit my niece and nephew so my sister can go out with her friends for a Christmas party. Her husband was working 3rd shift. 

She told me she‚Äôd be home at 11pm. At 2am She still isn‚Äôt home and I‚Äôm concerned because she isn‚Äôt answering the phone. She finally gets back to the house with some random dude. She comes in and the guy tries to come in too. I tell him to get back in his car and go home. He says no and I shove him back off the front stoop and luckily he took it as a sign to fucking leave. 

She is drunk and high on something and stumbling around making all kinds of noise. Her 4 year old son wakes up and comes down to see his mommy tripped over herself as she is trying to get a beer out of the fridge. He starts crying and she then goes upstairs to hold her 3 month old daughter. I block her and told her to just go to bed, she‚Äôs too drunk. She tries to claw her way past but she can‚Äôt move me because I outweigh her by 100 lbs. so she punches me right above my right eye and opens a cut. I still have a scar. So now I‚Äôm bloody as fuck and her son is screaming and I‚Äôm still blocking her from seeing her baby. She calls the cops. They come and handcuff me and put me in the squad car. About 10 minutes go by and they start asking me questions and I explain what happened.

Another 15 minutes and they take the cuffs off me and they bring her out in cuffs and throw her on the back of the car and take her ass to jail. 

She was charged with child endangerment, cocaine possession and nearly lost custody of her children later on down the line. Her husband(who is also a huge piece of shit) divorced her. A year later she left her kids without dying a word. That was 15 years ago and I‚Äôve seen her once since then.

8201,Who would win in a fight - Gandalf or Albus Dumbledore?,"A cursory glance tells me a lot of commenters don't understand Gandalf. 

Gandalf isn't even his real name. He's not even human. Or mortal for that matter. He is a Maia, a member of the Ainur, the divine beings that sang all of creation into existence at the dawn of time under Eru Iluvatar, the deity of their pantheon. On Middle Earth, he takes the form of an old man and has to leave behind a bulk of his power in order to be there. That being said, he still studied under divine beings far greater than he, as well as has the ring Narya, Ring of Fire which carries its own powers and will enhance Gandalf's own. 

When he ""casts a spell"" what he's really doing is *commanding* the world around him to listen and change. 

There is no winning this fight. Dumbledore might have flashier spells and quicker magic, but Gandalf is a literal divine being. Killing his mortal form doesn't kill the rest of him. Dumbledore on the other hand is a frail, ancient man. 

You're also disregarding that in an event they would meet, they would just sit down, drink tea, smoke and Dumbledore will pull candy out of his pockets.

The thing was it felt like it was 10 feet above my head, not like it was in the outer atmosphere.

2) Job hopping will be the best way to increase your salary, don't spend several years slaving away at a job for mediocre wage increases and the slight chance of a promotion. ***

3)Get professional qualifications along the way, chances are your degree is fluff, got an accounting degree? Do ACCA qualifications, going into project management? Get PRINCE2. Will you be working in IT systems? Learn Agile and Lean Siz Sigma. Make the most of any educational benefits available.

4) keep expanding your network both internally and externally, when you want to go to a new job, you will have a lot of people on hand who to reach out to.

5) make sure you know who is ultimately responsible for each part of the process of whatever you work with, map it out and it will be super helpful on referring to later. E.g. a PO, something as simple as a cost centre will have several SLT members responsible for data and policies that are used in that (finance assign budgets, audit and finance typically assign cost centre owners, BI data assign the meta data to it). Knowing the processes, tickets, and ownership behind everything will streamline a tonne of work for you.

As to point 2, I have had 6 jobs in 5 years, starting from a supply chain analyst at ¬£27,000, now I am a senior management consultant at ¬£93,000. Some of the people I started with as an analyst are in the same job and earn around 32k now. One was promoted after 4 years and earns 38k"

All the tales about dying an early death, ruining the environment, wrecking the economy, etc., are overblown, and come from the moral panic of a culture that needs _something_ to feel bad about.

Be prepared‚Ä¶

And survive‚Ä¶

What motivates me to do so? Well, there is always potential for governmental collapse or war. Supplies of food, water, critical essentials can be disrupted. We may rely on hunting, fishing, trapping, farming to secure food. Means of acquiring water may also require means outside of infrastructure. Rain collection or such and boiling.

Learning and respecting the use of firearms and bows for hunting as well as personal protection should infrastructure decay go so far as civil defence becomes the norm.

Edit: Using terms like ‚Äúdoomsday‚Äù is not apropos amongst most prepper/survivalist communities, as it lumps us with doomsayers. Being prepared and wanting to survive does not mean we also walk around blocks stating ‚Äúthe end is nigh‚Äù."

One day I was alone and walking up the stairs, just as I walked passed his apartment door it opened and he tried pulling me inside. I screamed as loud as I could and he released me.

8517,what is your favourite game?,"My favourite game is a two-way tie between Disco Elysium and  RuneScape! I know these couldn't be any more different from each other, but I love them both for different reasons and for what each of them did for me personally.  
First, Disco Elysium is a one-of-a-kind masterpiece in storytelling. Although it is regarded as a detective RPG, it defies the genre by creating a deep and wonderful, if spooky and unforgiving world, well-written and voiced characters, a multi-faceted noir story and much more I wouldn't want to spoil here. You play as an alcoholic detective who wakes up with amnesia in a weird retro sci-fi town, so you get to learn about and discover this world with the protagonist. I heavily recommend it to anyone I meet!   
Secondly, RuneScape has been in my life since I was in school, circa 2005, and I still gladly return to OSRS when I have some free time. The classic gameplay of the MMO, the nostalgic look, feel and sound of the game are all significant to me. It is also a great game in its own right, with hundreds of thousands of players still playing, especially on enhanced or modified communities like https://redemptionrsps.com/.  
Anyway, I hope I find fans of at least one of these games to share our fondness together. And who knows, maybe one day I'll find someone with the same two favourite games!"

Give them as much support as you can, visit often, send them letters, put money on their books so they can eat snacks and buy stamps, but don't blow smoke and tell them they're going to be able to come home. Be realistic. 

Don't go on those websites where prison families congregate. They're full of misinformation and outright myths and lies.

I think it would be more helpful to come up with a saying that encourages everyone, females included, to beware of ape* brain impulses in every aspect of life. Fireworks have no functional purpose at this point. It is the ape brain response to the flashing lights and noises that makes some people say ‚Äúoooh, aaaah.‚Äù Christmas lights and other holiday lights go in the same vein, they are an incredible waste of resources and production if you stop and think about it a moment. For no other reason than ‚Äúoooh, aaah.‚Äù With food, it is especially heinous, because we are rewarded by our brains for indulgences that I remember reading would have been extremely difficult for our ancestors to access even in rudimentary forms.

5314,Can a forest region become too overgrown? Can growth out compete breakdown? How does nature handle this?,"Yes, forests can routinely get overgrown.

There are a couple factors that limit this. Nature always has ways of finding some sort of equilibrium.

In many areas, especially dry climates like the forest regions of California, the overgrowth is handled by forest fires. Forest fires are natural and good when handled properly. If you allow many small natural forest fires, they won't become too intense. They just routinely burn out some of the overgrowth and keep things fresh. The problem with Modern California is that we have spent the last few decades stopping those forest fires, so the growth has grown larger and larger, so then when there is a forest fire it has a TON of fuel to grow massive and destructive.

Overgrowth is also limited by the available resources. There is only so much real estate. Only so many nutrients in the ground, only so much water, only so much square footage for sunlight. So as plants compete, eventually there are winners and losers. The loser plants will lack water/nutrients/sun, and will die away. That also limits the amount of overgrowth at a certain point. There is only so much growth an area can handle at maximum.

Then you factor human actions. People forget humans are natural creatures. Everything we do is a natural force on the environment, just human-made."

to the far gone Alzheimer's patients who have no grasp of self or time or place. many lost the ability to communicate. turning almost into animals really only being driven by primal urges like bathroom, food, pretty colors. etc. or in the worst cases where they become completely none verbal and you watch them waste away the days having to be hand fed to be kept going. constantly soiling themselves. you look into their eyes and that distinct look that an intelligent being is looking back at you is completely gone. the lights are on. but no ones home.

6121,whats an unbelievable story that turned out to be true?,"[USS Borie vs U-405.](https://i.redd.it/xlzaouo3t8241.png) 

Early in the morning on November 1, 1943, the old American destroyer USS Borie was part of an anti-submarine hunter-killer group in the Atlantic when she got a German submarine, U-405, on sonar. Borie likely damaged U-405 badly enough with her depth charges to force the sub to the surface, whereupon Borie dealt further damage to the sub with her 4"" and 20mm guns and killed the German crew trying to fire U-405's 3.5"" deck gun at Borie. 

The destroyer then moved in to try and ram the submarine and finish her off, but a last-second sharp turn by U-405 and a high wave lifted Borie's bow far enough up that she came down partially on top of the submarine at an angle rather than ramming straight through her, and the pair were stuck together. As a result, Borie's guns couldn't depress enough to hit U-405, and a firefight broke out between the crews of the two ships. Borie's crew used whatever weapons they could get their hands on to attack the German submariners attempting to reach the deck gun and her AA guns, from your standard submachine guns, rifles, shotguns, and pistols to some more... unorthodox weapons; one German sailor was killed after being shot in the chest with a flare gun, another was stabbed by a thrown knife, and another was knocked into the ocean by a thrown 4"" shell casing. 

The two finally managed to get dislodged, and with well over half of her crew dead, U-405 attempted to sneak away, though a few more 4"" shells from Borie finally disabled her. U-405 was scuttled by her crew, and thanks to attack from another U-boat, Borie would be unable to rescue any of her survivors. Borie herself was more badly damaged by the collision than initially thought, however, and would be scuttled as well the next day."

The concept of resource scarcity was not a thing, but external threats were, leading to a ""dog eat dog"" age of tribalism.

It was far safer for groups of Humans  to absorb one another, not co-exist, due to the other group one day potentially becoming a threat. This xenophobia is only heightened when they are  people different to their own when striving for  equality could hurt your current lifestyle.

Even if logically most humans can understand it, no one in regards to a decent chunk of the population is going to make the sacrifice. Our technological advancement out paced our evoloutionary advancement and the human psyche is understandably not well equipped for the change or scale of it. Humanity with nukes is a lot like an unsecured gun in a home with a child. Nothing is imminent, and hopefully nothing happens during our most precarious transition, but it's possible.

Pray for renewable tech and ways to clean up our environment or make peace with the fact that the rest of your life the overall state of world stability is going to get worse.

Things are not going to get better for the average human in the coming decades."

I like the way I look, and have never really been self conscious about my appearance which is nice. 

There are a few downsides for me. My friends in high school would often be self deprecating, and when I tried to counter them, they would scoff and say ""but you're a model"". This turned into several people dismissing my opinions, because I was a model.

I am a huge nerd, but often get dismissed/disbelieved about it, especially if I feel like wearing a pretty dress or dressing feminine.

I have had people think I am dumb/a slut because. I am conventionally attractive.

A lot of people are intimidated by me/think I am snooty or aloof when we first meet, since I take a while to warm up to people. The fact that I am unusually tall probably contributes to this also.

In recent generations, urbanization has increased, and many people have lost social and natural knowledge which for much of human history has been vital, but the adversity of the world is still very strong, and people still have to struggle to survive in the world and find themselves in it. The struggle doesn't look the same as it used to, due to technological advances and improvements in our civil liberties, but I think the psychological impacts are comparable.

If I have a bitcoin, I can sell the bitcoin for more money because people are speculating on it, but it's still worth whatever people value it as.
