Reality: Many ""gifted kids"" do need extra help in subjects they may not excel at, but may feel embarrassed to ask for it because of their label as ""gifted."" When their grades start to suffer in a subject, teachers/parents just say the kid is lazy and don't recognize what's actually going on. The kid then not only doesn't get the help they need, but also suffers insults from the very people who are supposed to help them. 

Also, beyond academics, ""gifted kids"" are perceived as more mature and having life figured out, when again, in reality, they're still just kids and need help making their ways through life, just like everyone else. They may not get the attention kids need from teachers/parents, because the assumption is they don't need it and/or other kids need it more."

Trying to get me to eat fancy hotel food (the airline had hooked us up) was surprisingly hard at the time.

The story goes that if you don't eat enough food during the day, your soul will leave your body and wander the halls looking for food. All night.

You're in this half lucid state where the only thing in your mind whilst in this soul projected state is an overwhelming sense of hunger and cold.

The thing is, if you don't return to your body before daylight, you can never return ever again, stuck to wander starving and cold with those thoughts only on your mind.

Needless to say I was scared shitless and spent many nights refusing to sleep out of fear, or stuffing myself till physically sick.

So 400 horses X 200lb = 80,000 lbs of pull force

1,000,000 ducks X 1lb = 1,000,000 lbs of pull force

#DUCKS WIN

2000 horses are needed to compete against the duck hoard

Edit: if all these horses are Clydesdales. Which one can pull 2000 lbs equating to 800,000 lbs of pull force for all of them the ducks still win by 200,000 lbs of pull force. Op said they are normal size horses so this doesn't matter"

I am forever grateful and thankful I’ve had to opportunity to witness a woman go from warrior to hard working hero. 

The first couple weeks after birth have redefined my definition of what a mom really is, and my respect level for women who go through with pregnancy has gone up 100-fold. 

Not only have I witnessed my wife’s body dramatically change in a year, I was stunned how somebody could do this sober as an ox. 

As a dad to be and now as a new dad, everyday offers a rollercoaster of developments and changes. Situations can go from happy to terrifying in a split second. The best advice I can offer is be as supportive as you can be."

13898,What character or story/franchise always gets ruined in adaptations?,"As you can probably tell from my profile pic, I’m a Silver Sable mark.

That said, I’ve been less than satisfied with most of her adaptations thus far because they primarily focus on her as an assassin and not as the leader of Symkaria’s resistance against every dictator from Katerina Karkov to Doctor Doom. This has worsened since Sony got the rights to Spider-Man because it means that they don’t have the rights to Latveria or ANY other fictional nation in the Marvel universe. Since Hollywood tends to avoid depicting any real-life government besides its own to avoid pissing off other nations by stereotyping and treating as collateral damage, Sony and Marvel have frequently opted to leave out Symkaria entirely because ‘us v them’ sends a bad message.

Because they’ve stripped away what makes her special, fans aren’t interested in the character despite her constant appearances in Spider-media. Thus, she never gets spun off so they can actually expand on her character. The only adaptation she’s had that’s even close to being good is Insomniac’s, and that wasn’t even until her DLC."

He told me his experience with the same feelings - some of which happened while I was a kid. How, at one point, he practically didn’t leave his room for three days because he was in the thick of it. 

It was way in the past, but to me it was incredibly heartbreaking to know that he suffered that but did it in a way that didn’t result in harming his relationship with me or my brothers. We all have a fantastic relationship with him and I consider him my mentor in many ways, father or not.

It’d been raining so the roads were still wet and slippery, anyhow sitting at the lights facing me to my right was a sports car. Typical cool guy driving it revving the engine at the lights and doof doof obnoxiously loud.

He got the green and accelerated too fast through the intersection turning to his right, so he was on my right hand side perhaps 50m away. The back of the car suddenly loses traction and spins out to its left towards to gutter, it goes up the curb and keeps swinging perhaps another 90 degrees.

There is a young woman about 15m away walking towards me on my right. She reached a side street just as she starts to cross the car loses control, she was hit from behind , caught in the swing of the car. She was flung like a rag doll  across the side street. She hit a stop sign right at the top, upside down. She then fell head first onto the footpath.

The car then rolled backwards down an embankment into a car park. I ran over with some other people and this poor woman was really fucked up, there was blood pouring from her head and nose onto the grass and concrete, she had grass and dirt all over her face and shirt and I reckon her right arm was broken.

The dickhead driver kind of stumbled around dazed but unhurt, an ambulance and police arrived in about 5 minutes, I was still waiting for the bus so I just got out of the way but I could see the ambos trying to revive her.

I spoke to the police for a bit,  eventually the ambos put her in the back and drove away without lights or sirens. Saw in the news about a week later she’d died and the police called me to give a statement.

The blood I can’t unsee how fast it spread across the concrete and grass it was horrible, the poor girl was just minding her business and suddenly she’s a tangled mess."

16099,What is the worst thing you have been caught doing by your parents?,"I used to masturbate onto birds at a local park. Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. First, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire, but if you're not as sexually charged as me, just take some porn on the go. After you're good and horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. Use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way, I haven't done it in years, but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully."

10599,People who live in urban areas what's the craziest crime you've witnessed?,"Crazy, mostly because of the fact that justice was enacted. 

I was helping my boyfriend’s band pack up after a show. Across the street from the bar, a car passed a dude on a bike, took a right turn directly in front of him, cutting him off in a bike land. The cyclist “spanked” the car’s trunk, which is something I’ve done as a bike punk in the past. 

Well, the naughty car’s driver didn’t appreciate the spank on his trunk. He swing around, doored the cyclist (slammed the guy with his car door to knock him down), and proceeded to throw him against the car and/or ground. This was directly across the street from me, and I could clearly see both of their faces and the car’s license plates. 

So, I called the cops. Gave them a love play-by-play of this guy beating the shit out of bike dude. Detailed descriptions of both, the car, even yelled, “Hey, I’m on the phone with 9-11, please don’t kill that guy!” The operator let me know they’d send someone. 

My boyfriend and his band were done packing, they were also my ride home. They told me they were heading out, but I said “I’m good. I’m staying.” They peaced out (scumbags). Once they left, the asshole in the car drove off. I talked to the bike dude a bit, he was a middle aged Latino dad, and he was pretty beat up and freaked out, so he didn’t want to wait for the cops. 

Cops came, I gave a statement, they basically said, “well, since bike dude left, there’s no real crime here” and they left. 

Got a call at 7am the next morning. The asshole with the car ended up being an undercover plainclothes cop, and this wasn’t his first problem on record. Internal Affairs asked me to come downtown to testify and everything. Apparently, he had been assaulting brown people in his spare time. 

He is no longer a cop."

A better question would be:  How would the world look without religious fundamentalism/extremism? 

Afterall, no one thinks religion is a bad thing if it's the vehicle a former gang banger uses to justify changing their life."

16858,"Time freezes: you’re the only one who’s moving, and it seems like this is going to last indefinitely. How do you keep yourself entertained and sane?","I'll assume everything in nature is working as normal, so I can actually interact with the environment, i.e. there is a sun and light, I can eat and drink and breathe, etc.

First, substance abuse.  I wander around in shock, disbelief, denial, and probably grab delicious food at a local restaurant and have some beers. Lots of beers. 

Food and water, even a local grocery store would provide years of food and water.    There'd probably be some very bad temptation for things of a sexual nature.  Hell, there are enough hot meals being served at restaurants that I can eat that for months. 

For entertainment, there is effectively an infinite amount of books to read,  and movies to watch.  
 
I'm a scientist, so I'd eventually start measuring, experimenting, and reporting everything I could think of.   I'd get some ass telescope and start measuring how the sun is working.  How the hell is the sun working.  I'd measure the position of stars, the moon, measure tides, etc. Look for astronomical events, is anything in the universe working?  I'd check out radioactive decay and half lifes.  I'd measure the coriolis force, track wind/weather patterns, et.

I'd get ham radio, etc and broadcast messages looking for other people.    I'd examine plant life, animal life, bacteria etc,  see if anything else seemed ""alive"".   I'd learn how to fly (and fix) airplanes and go check things out.

Keep a diary, count how many days have passed and what I did.

5766,What’s the worst sexual experience you’ve had?,"She started crying. Like full on bawling with tears streaming.

We'd been fuck buddies for months, meeting up to smash once or twice a week. I was pretty much done with relationships after my 2nd engagement crashed and burned and told her so upfront.

We're going at it like normal, in missionary position, when I inexplicably said ""I love you"". It was just reflex, something I'd gotten used to saying during really passionate sex with my SO's...

Damn near instantly she starts wailing. Full on bawling happy tears uncontrollably, while still grinding into me. I'm feeling instantly guilty because what I said wasn't true and confused at her reaction. Lost my erection pretty quick.

She had pretty bad self esteem issues. Had never had a boyfriend at 26 and was just used to being used for sex and nothing more because of how neurotic she could be. So when I said those 3 words, something she'd dreamed of hearing her whole life and never had, something broke inside her. She was overwhelmed with happiness and joy and relief and every emotion at once.

I got off her and started getting dressed, trying to figure out how I was going to break it to her that I'd fucked up and didn't actually feel that way about her.

She regained her composure and apologized for startling me, said we could finish and then shyly asked if that meant I wanted her to be my girlfriend...

I could feel my soul being crushed in real time. I really liked her and didn't want to hurt her, but I couldn't lie.

I told her the truth, that it just slipped out from habit and I didn't actually love her like that. Her face went from being flushed with joy to being deflated and instead of tears streaming down like before, they just slowly started moving down her cheeks. She was silent and embarrassed.

I felt like a colossal jerk. She was great after all, I really did like her, but I was broken at that point. I'd been hurt too often and just sort of sealed myself off from those emotions.

On the ride home she said she understood and wasn't mad or anything but I could tell she was deeply hurt, the sudden whiplash of thinking it had finally happened, a guy had fell in love with her, to realizing she was still unlovable was still raw.

We met up a few times after that but the sex was never the same, always felt phony from then on. I could always sense a sort of anger just under the surface from her.

Years later she hit me up, she was married and had a 2 year old. I was still single but had stopped wanting to be by then. The years of being emotionally unavailable had passed and I once again wanted to feel love but I was past my prime. I was now a late 30's loser and increasingly finding it hard to find a woman that wanted me.

It was then that I realized what an idiot I'd been. She was still beautiful and the love of her husband had cured her, had stopped her neurosis and allowed her to blossom into an amazing mature woman. One I'd have died to have in my life. One I had a chance to have and pissed it away from being broken.

I look back and think maybe it wasn't muscle memory that made me blurt that out. Maybe it was my sub conscious trying to snap me into realizing the potential that was there. I missed my chance but I'm glad she found happiness and love at least."

Everyday I'd get home from work, there would be three kids in my room playing games and I didn't mind at all.

Then soon after, their Mom would shout and we'd all line up with plates in the hallway and she would feed us all. I used to get a plate of home cooked *good* food everyday, which was a godsend because I wasn't good at feeding myself.

How can we love if everything ends in sadness? Alone. Perhaps a creature as simple as a chicken can grasp these concepts. Maybe intelligence is a burden or maybe even bliss. Either way it is the shackle of knowledge that keeps us in place. Unable to think, unable to live. It is the simplest of beings that can truly comprehend what it is they need to accomplish in the short time we have. That is to run.

Two of my sons smoked pot as teens and I spoke to them about it and made them aware of the dangers of gateway drugs because although many people can stop at just weed, a lot of others such as myself start experimenting with other drugs once they try weed.  Thankfully that’s all they ever got into. My daughter is 13 turning 14 and I hope she doesn’t ever get into drugs but I doubt it as she is very focused on study and is ambitious and I have been quite open about my struggles as a young man and she has no intention of ever touching drugs.  It’s important for parents to know who their kids hang around and what they do.

Idk if that makes sense, but I feel like you need some teen relationship problems and the advice that your parents can give you from those to prepare for the real thing in a way."
