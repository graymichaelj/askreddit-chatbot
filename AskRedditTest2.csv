6503,"People who’s house has been broken into, what is your story?","I was 18, it was my first apartment.  It was me, my girlfriend and a roommate.  I owned a rifle that was an old nazi rifle from ww2.  I heard glass break on the back patio, woke up and grabbed my rifle.  Told my girlfriend to lock herself in the bathroom and not open the door until I told her.  She called the police and I went to investigate.  I came around the corner of the kitchen with my rifle up and ready, racked a round into the chamber and the sound scared the man, as he turned to run and slipped on the glass and fell hitting his head on the fridge.  It took about 10 minutes for the police to arrive while I held him at gunpoint.  Turns out he fit the MO for a man who broke into houses and sexually assaulted women over the last year and they hadn't caught him. Police think he had been following my girlfriend home from work at the mall and watching her before he decided to break in.  I worked out of town a lot at the time and my vehicle was in the shop and the police think that  he thought she was home alone.  Who knows what would've happened if I hadn't been home.  My room mate slept though the entire thing up until the police showed up so he wouldn't have been much help.  Luckily I didn't have to shoot the man who broke in but I would've if it came to that."

9081,What did you do today?,"Was playing Fallout 1. And at one point one of the guards from the group I was in in Adytum accidentally shot another guard. So they all turned on each other and started shooting. Then one of them missed and hit a town person, and I guess at some point one accidentally shot an orphan.

So the entire town was attacking everybody at this point. After about half an hour of this, combat fnally ended after 1/3 of the people had died. The survivors were mostly seriously injured so were just standing around in the streets instead of oging back to where they should be. One of the orphans even made it through to the end which is really impressive.

God I love this game."

A comedian does a set in front of 100ppl.

99 think the comedian is hilarious.

1 person thinks the comedian is offensive.

If the 1 person makes enough noise, that comedian is done.

The problem is that 1person doesnt take personal responsibility and decide they just aren't going to support or view that comedian. They could walk out or turn their back, but instead, they scream ""I was offended and you should be too and this comedian shouldn't be allowed to work because of how they made me feel.""

Cancel culture has made it so that the minority of people who are offended are validated instead of simply telling them ""If you dont like it, dont watch it."""

3785,What is the most disturbing encounter with a stranger you've ever had?,"I ended up in a mental clinic in one of two wards. The ward I spent my first week in was for the severely mentally ill. I went to sleep after dinner and was woken up by a guy who went into the room full of sleeping ladies just to wake me up. He told me he noticed me during dinner and asked me to leave the room and go with him to the place for smokers. Our conversation started out normally. He asked me what I had done for them to place me in a psych ward, where I lived and if I had any friends. Then suddenly he started telling me I was going to be his girlfriend and that we would have sex when we go out and what he'd do to me during it. There was absolute madness in his eyes, although he remained calm and kind throughout the conversation. He started kissing my hands, calling me per ma'am and hugging me, calling me his girlfriend. I know a lot of women have experienced similar behaviour, but he was completely out of his mind and I was wondering whether he could harm me against my will and thought that he was capable of that. He was really ill. That was the first time a man showed sexual interest in me and I found it terrifying. When I was moved to the ward for less severely ill, I was told that he was trying to assault another female patient and basically treated that way every woman he met. He was so crazy he had to be delivered to the ward by the police after he had destroyed something because he was pretending to be skilled at martial arts. He told me that with a grin on his face, asking me if I was also transported by the cops as if it was a normal way to get to psych ward. He reminded me of Hannibal Lecter, but he wasn't charming and was DEFINITELY less intelligent. He seemed nice and kind on the outside but he was very disordered once he felt safe."

I told him that when we met in person, we could go on a date and take it from there. So we flirted uncommitted until we met and did exactly that. It went well and we continued on to have a healthy long-distance relationship until he moved in with me

I’ve seen others have successful relationships where the dating begins online, but it’s just not something I’m personally comfortable with, nor would I recommend. Not everyone is smart, safe, or mature about it and end up getting catfished or worse"

11807,"[Serious] What figure do you most admire (You may choose from any field (arts, literature, politics, business, etc) and why?","J.S. Bach; he excelled in every musical form of his day (except for opera, because he didn't live in a center for such). He is the epitome of composer as industrious craftsman; his musical genius was rooted in the tradition of his time, to the extent that he was overlooked after his death as a composer whose style time had passed by. Even one of his sons called him, perhaps with some affection, ""the old wig."" But among composers he was never forgotten; Mozart and Beethoven both admired his work, and Mendelssohn was instrumental in reviving his popularity among the average person. His [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr0f6t2UbOo), has IMHO, a organic quality; there is nothing saccharine in its moments of beauty, nothing grandiose in its more serious moments. He wrote music for the earnest beginner and for the virtuoso. For me listening to Bach is humbling and encouraging, both because of his skill, but also because he was, at end of day, just a frail human being like all of us, who dealt with the death of a spouse, bickered with local officials, was made proud by and was disappointed by his sons, and who dealt with blindness in old age. Bach's music is a reminder that even in troubled times,  things can still work out. Life allows us a little bit of happiness. Sometimes there is peace and order to be found."

These couples who are trying to fix/avoid problems by having an open relationship usually have lots of rules/conditions which always (in my experience) end up getting broken, and it never works out for them.

I'm glad that I've had the experiences I've had, but mainly because it reinforced for me that I am monogamous. It's not always easy and it has its trade-offs, but I really cherish the safety, relative simplicity, and deep intimacy that (for me) only a monogamous relationship can provide. I wake up and choose my partner every day and that commitment provides the foundation upon which we build a rich rewarding life together... I have an ex-wife/coparent as well and it's important to me that we all get along and are friendly, and I have to - at times - balance competing perspectives/desires, but I am very consciously building something with my partner that requires that I give her my loyalty and fidelity... and I do so graciously and joyously.

I think monogamy is really worth the investment for the majority of people out there."

If it’s weapon fire likely we’d hit it with everything we got, such as nuclear weapons or high powered explosive ordinance. While a message may result in negotiations for landing or safety depending on factors of reasoning. E.g Diplomatic trade, refugee from war/planetary destruction.

I was an ivf, conceived in 2000 with 7 other eggs. My mum took 2 eggs (the recommended amount because usually 1 failed) and also fell naturally pregnant and ended up with triplets. However, only one of the triplets survived; my “older brother” 2 years later (2002) my mum decided to try again and ended up having me. Here’s where it gets whacky. If my brother was one of the ivf eggs then we are technically the same age. I just stayed in the fridge for 2 extra years frozen in time. But if he was the natural birth than I am older than my older brother. 

And to add on to it. My parents divorced when I was 1 week old. My dad could barely afford anything while paying child support and had to work often so my brother and I were in and out of daycares. Meanwhile my mum works in defence so she sometimes left to fight in wars.
